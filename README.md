# Learning-Log

Learning Log will be a web application that allows users to log the topics they're interested in and make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log homepage will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once a user is logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries and read and edit existing entries.Â
